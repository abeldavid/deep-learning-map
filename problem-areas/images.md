# Images

Work in progress, started 13 June 2018.

### Main tasks
- Image classification
	- Datasets: ImageNet, CIFAR
	- Approaches: CNNs
- Related: Transfer learning
	- Approach: pre-training networks on ImageNet and then retraining on more specific datasets
- Image segmentation
	- Approach: fully connected networks (convolutions and deconvolutions)
- Object detection
- Image generation
	- Approaches: GANs, SAGAN
- Related task: Differentiating between real and fake images
	- Problem: generators / GANs are becoming more powerful, generated images are becoming more realistic

### Main problems (bottlenecks, issues)
- Adversarial examples: Classifiers easily tricked (with small perturbations or stickers)


### Main approaches
- see above

### State of the art

### Connections with other problem areas
