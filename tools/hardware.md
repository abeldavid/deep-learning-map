# Hardware

Hardware is important because more compute means you can train models faster and, with that, run more experiments more quickly. Some people also claim that haing more compute can solve some of the problems in ML.

## Neuromorphic computing 
Attempting to design chips that work like the human brain
- MIT
	- Designed small chips with artificial synapses (silicon germanium) where they can precisely control the strength of an electric current flowing across it, similar to the way ions flow between neurons. 
	- Results: In simulations, the researchers found that the chip and its synapses could be used to recognize samples of handwriting, with 95 percent accuracy.
